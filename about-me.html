                <p class="about-me">Thanks for checking out my site! My name is Joel Fasnacht, but some people call me Joey. 
                    (I don't have a preference, and I'll answer to either!) I'm a first year student at Thaddeus Stevens College,
                    in the Computer Software Engineering Techonology Program. I work part-time at Martins Flooring, as an installer, 
                    and I spend the rest of my free time either cooking, or playing video games. I have a cornsnake named Marty, 
                    and a cat named Tobe (like Kobe). As I am new to coding, and I'm not sure of what the possibilities are, and what
                    interests me the most, I'm not sure what my goal for after school is. I know I want to work for a company, or be 
                    in a position that will allow me to keep learning. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is also a priority, and 
                    being in a fun and energetic environment. Enjoy the gallery Below, highlighting the amazing people, pets, food, and 
                    moments in my life.  </p>
